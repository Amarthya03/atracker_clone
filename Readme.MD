# ATracker Clone

## _About this Project_

I needed a time tracker app, and found this amazing app. I was too stingy to pay for the premium subscription, so I decided to learn React Native and build it myself.

## Steps to run the app

-   Clone the repository.
-   Run <code>npm install</code>
-   Run <code>npx expo start</code>
-   Ensure Expo Go application is installed on your device. Use your scanner to scan the QR that gets displayed on the terminal to access the application.
